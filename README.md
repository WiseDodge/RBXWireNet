# RBXWireNet 🚀

**A Python-based client library for interacting with Roblox Open Cloud APIs focused on correlational data extraction.**

RBXWireNet provides clean, modular, and extensible access to Roblox’s modern Open Cloud API endpoints such as the GROUP_LOCATOR API and related group, user, and game data sources. It empowers developers to authenticate securely, query correlational data from root community IDs, and manage information with proper API key handling and pagination support.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔑 **Secure API Key Management** — Uses environment variables and `.env` support for safe storage of API keys.
- 🔄 **Modular API Client** — Easily extendable architecture supporting multiple Roblox Open Cloud APIs including groups, users, and games.
- 📦 **Group Locator Support** — Initial implementation for GROUP_LOCATOR service focused on extracting correlational data from groups.
- 🔮 **Future Proof Design** — Planned extensions for allies, membership, join requests, users, games, and relational mapping capabilities.
- 🧪 **Testable & Maintainable** — Project structure supports unit testing and clean code separation.
- 🗺️ **Relational Mapping (Future)** — Potential ability to build relational maps linking groups, users, and games for deeper insight.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

Set your Roblox Open Cloud API key as an environment variable before running:

```
export RBXWIRENET_API_KEY="your_real_api_key"
```

Or create a `.env` file in the project root with:

```
RBXWIRENET_API_KEY=your_real_api_key
```
